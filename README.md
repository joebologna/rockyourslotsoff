Concept: To write a series of articles showing how to use different methods of creating a slot machine server and reporting play stats, such as Spins, % Wins, $ Won, $ Balance

# Approach

Write articles showing how to do it by serving a web page using a server in the cloud (new-norm.com) in Go and compare it to C/C++. Create a client to access the service using Pythonista for iOS where you can play a game or watch a game in progress. Document the journey on New Norm as articles and post to Medium account using imports.
